# EmojiMood-Emoji-Generator-from-Text
 EmojiMoodÂ is an interactive web app that converts any sentence or emotional expression into a custom string of emojis. Using Hugging Face Transformers for sentiment analysis and keyword-based emotion detection, EmojiMood understands positive, negative, or neutral moods and augments them with representative emojisâ€”from ðŸ˜‚ and ðŸ˜Š to ðŸ˜¢ and ðŸ˜ . A Gradio interface makes it easy to deploy locally or share publicly with one line of code.
